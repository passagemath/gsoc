# passagemath GSoC ideas list


## Port to Pyodide (WebAssembly)

[Pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide) is a Python distribution for the browser and Node.js based on WebAssembly (WASM).
Several dependencies (non-Python packages, Python libraries) have already been ported to Pyodide and are part of the Pyodide distribution.
A GSoC project would now make a subset of the passagemath distributions available in Pyodide. 
As an application, serverless interactive documentation of the passagemath library could be built, where code examples can be executed directly in the browser.

## Full integration of Normaliz

[passagemath-polyhedra](https://pypi.org/project/passagemath-polyhedra/) contains interfaces to [Normaliz](https://www.normaliz.uni-osnabrueck.de/), the state-of-the-art library by Bruns et al. for computations with polyhedra, cones, lattice points, etc.
By far not all features of Normaliz are exposed in passagemath-polyhedra. 
A GSoC project would expand the existing interface, aiming for full coverage.

Mentor: [Matthias Köppe](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~mkoeppe/)

Required skills: Solid knowledge of polyhedral geometry or/and commutative algebra, Python experience

Length: 90 to 350 hours


## Full integration of Macaulay2

[passagemath-macaulay2](https://pypi.org/project/passagemath-macaulay2/) already provides a low-level interface to Macaulay2 dating back to the early days of Sage development. A GSoC project would update the interface and expose much of Macaulay2's functionality in particular in algebraic geometry on a high level of abstraction.

Mentor: [Matthias Köppe](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~mkoeppe/)

Rquired skills: Solid knowledge of Macaulay2; Python experience

Length: 90 to 350 hours
